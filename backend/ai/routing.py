"""use_case -> executable Model: a single route or a cross-platform FallbackModel.

Fallback policy (终稿 5.3): only rate limits, timeouts, network errors and 5xx
move to the next candidate. Auth errors, malformed-request 4xx and capability
mismatches abort immediately — retrying them elsewhere just burns money.

The fallback_on hook doubles as the failure-accounting tap: every failed
attempt is written to the usage ledger BEFORE the chain moves on (rules 第八章).

铁律: fallback only ever happens before the first token. Once a stream has
started, FallbackModel never re-enters another model — mid-stream failures
surface as an SSE error event (see client.py).
